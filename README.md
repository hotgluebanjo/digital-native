# Digital Native

An experimental set of primaries aiming for the ideal oxymoron of a camera-agnostic camera native space.

Each primary is chosen from a dataset consisting of extrapolated virtual primaries from cameras with known matrices.

This is very much brute-force. There's no rotational scaling or correction, and it relies on general similarity.
